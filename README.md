# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.

# A little back-ground:
Prior to this tutorial, I understood the idea behind git and GitHub as a version control and collaboration tool,
but never actually learned how to create a project and had no idea on the actual procedures of having a main branch, 
having change branches where code is being tested, then the process of pulling and committing and reviewing before the
branches are merged. 5 minutes into the tutorial and I feel a lot more confident and excited to start my own projects
and invite other devs to join me. 


### I shouldn't have .gitignore'd all this power for so long.
